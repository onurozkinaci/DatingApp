    <ol>
        <li>Open Chrome dev tools! Then check the failing request in the network tab</li>
        <li>Examine the request URL - What API endpoint are you requesting?</li>
        <!-- if you can reproduce the problem in Postman,it guarantees that the problem is not related with Angular,it is related with the API(server). -->
        <li>Reproduce the problem in Postman</li> 
    </ol>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Following is the stack trace - the first few lines will tell you which line of code caused the issue in the API</p>
